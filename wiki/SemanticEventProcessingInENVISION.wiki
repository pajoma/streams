== Abstract ==

The Semantic Sensor Web provides a framework for the interoperable exchange and processing of observation data from heterogeneous sensor networks. Environmental monitoring applications deal with change detection in a spatiotemporal context. Here it is required to analyze vast amounts
of sensor data in order to react to speciﬁc situations. In the ENVISION project, we explore how to enhance this process of sense&respond by using Complex Event Processing (CEP) techniques. CEP allows deﬁning situations of change in observable variables using event patterns. By combining event processing and semantic technologies we are able to process time-series of observations from diﬀerent sources and communicate the inferred events to interested communities in near real-time.
